I--> input
O --> output

--> it means node has single thread 
-->Async:- it process multiple request at a time
-->Non block:- it can't block any request

========================
node js have single thread and node have event loop every request has one event so when request come in node js the request will go event loop and every request has one event after completed
event it give response (callback) and it can process multiple request at a time and it can't stop any request
